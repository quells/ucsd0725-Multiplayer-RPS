/*
== Architecture Overview ==

= Model =
- Gets updates from Firebase (reactive/automatic)
- Pushes updates to Firebase (reactive/automatic)
- Other actors can register callbacks to run when specified updates happen (reactive)
    ie View will register callback for newly connected players
    maybe only for diffs: `added`, `removed`, `changed`

= View =
- Handles updating UI (imperative interface)
- Other actors can register callbacks to run when user interacts with UI (reactive)
    ie click events, mainly

= Controller =
- Keeps track of app state
    Lobby, Challenge Received / Challenge Pending, Battle In Progress
- Request Queue? Cleared on entering battle
- Registers callbacks with Model for updates
    Filter through state machine
    Pass on to View or discard
