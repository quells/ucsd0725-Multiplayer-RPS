# Back-and-Forth Challenges Do Not Display

Summary:
Cannot send challenges back and forth if one is cancelled.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Have two instances of the app open.
2. In Window 1, challenge the player in Window 2.
3. In Window 1, cancel the challenge.
4. In Window 2, challenge the player in Window 1.
5. See bug in Window 1.

Expected Result:
Player in Window 1 sees challenge from Window 2.

Actual Result:
Player in Window 1 never sees challenge, despite the request existing on the server.

Reproducible:
Always

Notes:
Related to `considerSnapshot` being equal to `self.consideringMatchWith`. Tried to use flag to fix, but was not successful. Perhaps `self.consideringMatchWith` is not being reset correctly.
